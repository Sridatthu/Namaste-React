## ▶ Running the Project

Start the development server with:

or
```sh

## 📦 Building for Production

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

- **Parcel isn't working? Try clearing the cache:**
  ```sh
  npx parcel clean
  ```

- **Ensure you have the latest version of Parcel:**
  ```sh
  npm update parcel
  ```

- **Favicon issue? If you see an error about `favicon.ico`, create a blank file in the root directory:**
  ```sh
  touch favicon.ico
  ```
